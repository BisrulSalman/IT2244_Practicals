## 📝 Palindrome Checker Script - Bash

### 📄 Description:
This is a simple Bash script that checks whether a given word is a **palindrome** or not. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., *madam*, *level*, *radar*).

---

### 🚀 How It Works:
1. The script prompts the user to enter a word.
2. It calculates the length of the word.
3. It compares characters from the beginning and end moving inward.
4. If all corresponding characters match, it confirms the word is a palindrome.
5. Otherwise, it reports that the word is not a palindrome.

### 💻 Usage:

```bash
$ chmod +x palindrome.sh      # Make the script executable
$ ./palindrome.sh             # Run the script
Enter the word: madam
The word is a Palindrome
```
